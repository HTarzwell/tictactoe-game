# Project Content

This is a tic-tac-toe game, build primarily using Javascript, JQuery, and AJAX,
with some HTML and CSS.  It is hosted on an API local to General Assembly.

# Project Timeline

I began this project on February 7th, 2018.

## Wireframing

The project's wireframes can be found at //site//, along with user stories.
There were some visible differences in the planned wireframe and the end product
which stemmed directly from a sense of overscoping and an excess of optimism about
how much time would be needed to complete the game to my satisfaction.  User
stories were refined multiple times over the course of the project to account for
developments in the project timeline.

## Game Logic

I began work on the project's game logic system on February 8th.  This proved to
be the most difficult, time-consuming, and (I was initially convinced) unfruitful
component of the game creation process, as repeated difficulties slowed the process
of the project overall.  The win condition in particular proved difficult, as many
misunderstandings and false starts prevented its completion until the Monday before
the project's due date. Additionally, I discovered later that 1) while the game's
logic worked in Node, this logic did not translate well into working with the pages's
HTML elements, and 2) I had not built in a turn-based player condition to the logic,
which further hampered progress.

## User APIs

The user APIs were completed on Monday, February 12th, with only relatively minor
issues.  I received very solid support in handling these problems and came away with
an increased understanding of how APIs and curl requests behave.

## Game UX

Almost all of my game UX and visible game board was constructed from scratch between
Sunday, February 11th and Tuesday, February 13th.  The majority of my time was consumed
by attempting to integrate the game's logic with the board's layout in HTML, failing, and
then constructing new logic that would allow full manipulation using jQuery.  This is
where my conceptions of creating beautiful, DRY code went completely out the window.
I was able to submit the project with a marginally function game UI, and discovered that
I was able to reconstruct the win condition and add a player-exchange function due to
many days spent wresting with JavaScript logic.

## Game APIs

Game APIs are still an ongoing process.

# Takeaways

I learned through this project that there are a number of misconceptions I had about
how a developer must progress, and also that while frustration in the coding process can
seem like a setback, it also enhances and promotes learning in a way that few other
processes in my lifetime have managed.

# Projected End Date

This project must be completed for final submission by February 25th, 2018.  Initial
submission date was February 14th.
